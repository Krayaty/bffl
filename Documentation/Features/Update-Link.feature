feature: Update-Link
  as a User I want to be able to find my shortened URLs on the main page in a List view. By clicking on an entry I want to be able to change the entry. I want to see a view that shows me all changeable fields. With click on submit all changes should be saved. With click on cancel I the changes should be discarded.
